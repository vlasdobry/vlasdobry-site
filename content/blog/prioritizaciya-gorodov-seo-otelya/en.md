**TL;DR:** To prioritize cities, look beyond traffic volume. Focus on quality metrics: bounce rate, time on site, pages per session. A city with 3,000 visits and 13% bounce is more valuable than one with 15,000 visits and 25% bounce.

SEO budgets are limited. Creating geo-landing pages for all 50 cities your guests come from isn't realistic. You need to pick 5-10 priority regions and focus on them.

How do you choose? Let me walk you through a methodology using real data from a resort hotel.

## Why Traffic Volume Is a Poor Criterion

A common mistake: looking only at visit counts. New York generates 60,000 visits, Denver only 3,000. So New York matters more, right?

Not always. Here's data from the same hotel:

| City | Visits | Bounce | Time on Site | Pages/Visit |
|------|--------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| New York | 60,000 | 14% | 3:54 | 3.6 |
| Denver | 2,700 | 13.8% | 7:57 | 7.0 |

Denver shows nearly double the time on site and double the pages per visit. This means: Denver visitors are closer to booking. They're studying rooms, rates, amenities. New Yorkers often browse and leave.

## Traffic Quality Metrics

I use four metrics from Google Analytics to assess quality:

### Bounce Rate

Percentage of visitors who left immediately. For hotels, 15-20% is normal. If bounce exceeds 25%, traffic quality is low or your landing page doesn't match the search intent.

**What's good:**
- < 15% — excellent
- 15-20% — normal
- 20-25% — needs attention
- > 25% — problem

### Time on Site

Minutes spent on your website. For a hotel with a booking engine, 3-5 minutes is normal. Under 2 minutes means they never reached room selection.

**What's good:**
- > 5 minutes — high intent
- 3-5 minutes — normal
- 1-3 minutes — casual interest
- < 1 minute — accidental visit

### Pages per Session

How many pages a visitor viewed. For a hotel with 5+ room types, 3-4 pages is normal. 6+ pages means they're studying details, close to booking.

### Conversion to Booking

The ultimate metric, but not always available by city. If you have it, use it. If not, the combination of three metrics above gives a similar picture.

## Prioritization Methodology

I divide cities into 4 tiers:

### Tier 1: Critical Priority

**Criteria:** high volume + good quality metrics

Cities with lots of traffic AND good quality. Direct your main budget here.

For our hotel, that's New York and Los Angeles. Yes, they don't have the best bounce rates, but the volume is huge. 14% bounce on 60,000 visits means 51,000 quality sessions.

**Actions:**
- Create geo-landing pages "/from-new-york/", "/from-la/"
- Content about logistics: flights, transfers, travel time
- Keywords: "hotel [destination] from [origin city]"

### Tier 2: High Potential

**Criteria:** medium volume + excellent quality metrics

Cities with modest traffic but very high engagement. These visitors are ready to book — they just need more content.

In our case: Denver, Portland, Austin, Nashville. All have bounce under 14% and time on site over 4.5 minutes.

**Actions:**
- Geo-landing pages with route information
- Regional promotions ("10% off for Denver residents")
- Targeted ads to test hypotheses

### Tier 3: Medium Priority

**Criteria:** high volume + mediocre metrics

Lots of traffic, but quality is lacking. Don't expand reach — improve conversion.

In our example: Chicago, Houston, Phoenix. Bounce 23-25%, time 3-4 minutes.

**Actions:**
- Audit landing pages — why are they leaving?
- Improve mobile experience
- Test different offers

### Tier 4: Low Priority / Exclude

**Criteria:** any volume + poor metrics OR bot traffic

Cities with bounce over 30% or anomalous patterns (bounce 0.8% = bots). Spending budget here is pointless.

In our example: overseas VPN traffic (bounce 0.8% — clearly bots), certain regions with 86% bounce, and low-engagement international markets.

**Actions:**
- Exclude from reporting
- Don't spend budget
- Block in ad settings if necessary

## Practical Example: Prioritization Matrix

Here's the final table for a resort hotel (3 months of data):

| Tier | Cities | Visits | Bounce | Action |
|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | New York, LA | 82,000 | 14-20% | Geo-landing pages, main budget |
| 2 | Denver, Portland, Austin, Nashville | 27,000 | 13-20% | Geo-landing pages, test campaigns |
| 3 | Chicago, Houston, Phoenix | 30,000 | 23-26% | Optimize landing pages |
| 4 | Bot traffic, low-engagement regions | 14,000 | 0.8-86% | Exclude from analytics |

## Implementation Recommendations

### Quick Wins (1-2 weeks)

**Geo-landing pages for Tier 1.** Create "/from-new-york/" and "/from-la/" pages with:
- How to get there (flights, driving)
- Travel time
- Airport transfers
- Special offers for residents

**Update Title and Description.** Add geo-keywords to meta tags: "Beach Resort — Book from New York".

### Medium Term (1-2 months)

**Route content.** For driving-distance cities, create "How to drive here" guides. This captures long-tail queries.

**Geo-landing pages for Tier 2.** After NY and LA, build pages for high-engagement cities.

**Regional promotions.** "Denver residents: 10% off weekday stays". Test with PPC, then scale.

### Long Term (3-6 months)

**Local SEO in source markets.** Add to Google Business: "We welcome guests from New York, Los Angeles, Denver...".

**UGC from different cities.** Collect reviews mentioning origin: "We drove from Austin, loved it". Social proof for locals.

**Partnerships with regional travel agents.** Especially valuable for Tier 2 cities with high engagement.

## What to Monitor

After implementation, track:

| Metric | Goal | Frequency |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Rankings for geo-queries | Top 10 | Weekly |
| Traffic from target cities | +20% per quarter | Monthly |
| Bounce by city | < 20% | Monthly |
| Booking conversion by city | > 0.5% | Monthly |

## How to Strengthen the Analysis

This methodology delivers 80% of results. Here's what to add for more precision:

**Check demand with keyword research.** Bounce and time show existing traffic quality. But how many people actually search "beach resort from denver"? If it's 50 searches a month, a geo-landing page may not pay off. Verify search volume before building pages.

**Track micro-conversions, not just time.** Instead of overall time on site, monitor specific actions: opened booking module, viewed 3+ room types, clicked phone number. This shows purchase intent more accurately.

**Connect with PMS data.** New York brings volume, but what's the average check? If Denver guests book suites while New Yorkers grab discounted standards, priorities shift. Export booking data by city and compare with ADR.

**Test hypotheses with PPC first.** Before building a geo-landing page, run an ad campaign for "beach resort from denver" for 2 weeks. Check conversion. If it works — invest in SEO. Cheaper than building pages upfront.

**Use UGC instead of landing pages for Tier 2.** High-engagement cities are perfect for user-generated content. Collect guest stories: "How we drove from Austin with kids". That's content, social proof, and keywords — without development costs.

**Calculate ROI.** How much does a geo-landing page cost? How many bookings did it generate? Without these numbers, you can't tell what's working. Set up UTM tags and track the path from page to payment.

## FAQ

**How often should I revisit priorities?**
Quarterly. Seasonality affects geography: summer brings families from regional cities, winter brings corporate groups from major metros.

**What about international traffic?**
If bounce is under 25% and time exceeds 2 minutes — work with it. If metrics are poor — exclude from priorities but don't block the traffic.

**Do I need separate landing pages for every city?**
For Tier 1 — absolutely. For Tier 2 — ideally. For Tier 3 and 4 — no, better to optimize existing pages.
