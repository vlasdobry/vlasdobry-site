**TL;DR:** Hotel SEO starts with technical foundation (robots.txt, sitemap.xml, Schema.org), continues with local SEO (Google Maps, Bing Places) and reputation management. First results appear in 3-6 months.

Hotel business thrives on direct bookings. Every guest coming directly from search saves 15-25% in OTA commissions. SEO is one of the key channels for this.

## Where to Start

Before diving into optimization, you need to audit your current website state. What to check:

- **robots.txt** — must exist and allow indexing
- **sitemap.xml** — sitemap for search engines
- **HTTPS** — mandatory for any booking website
- **Mobile version** — over 60% of hotel searches are from phones

## Technical SEO

Technical foundation is the basis of all promotion. Without it, content and links don't work.

### Core Web Vitals

Google evaluates three user experience metrics:

- **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint) — main image should load in 2.5 sec
- **FID/INP** — page interactivity
- **CLS** — layout stability during loading

Critical for hotels: room galleries often break CLS due to lazy loading without set dimensions.

### Schema.org for Hotels

Minimum markup set:

- **Hotel** — basic hotel information
- **LocalBusiness** — for local search
- **FAQPage** — FAQ in rich snippets

## Local SEO

For hotels, local search is half the success. Guests search for "hotel in [city]", "accommodation near [landmark]".

### Google Maps and Bing Places

Map listings should be:

- Fully completed (photos, description, amenities)
- With current contacts
- With responses to all reviews

### NAP Consistency

NAP (Name, Address, Phone) must be identical everywhere:

- On website
- On maps
- In directories
- On social media

## Reputation Management

Reviews affect local search ranking and conversion from viewing to booking.

### Where to Collect Reviews

Platform priority for hotels:

1. Google Maps
2. TripAdvisor
3. Booking.com
4. Yelp (for US market)

### Handling Negative Reviews

Negative reviews are an opportunity to show service. Response rules:

- Respond within 24 hours
- Thank for feedback
- Offer a solution
- Don't argue publicly

## FAQ

**How much does hotel SEO cost?**
From $500/month for comprehensive promotion. Price depends on region, room count, and competition.

**How soon will results appear?**
First rankings in 3-6 months. Local SEO shows results faster — from 1-2 months.

**Can I do without SEO?**
Yes, but it's expensive. OTAs take 15-25% from each booking. SEO is an investment in reducing dependence on intermediaries.
