llmsSummary: "Case study: evaluating Google Ads potential for a permanent LED lighting installer in Los Angeles. Methodology: Google Keyword Planner API data vs industry benchmarks. Key findings: impression ceiling in LA is 1,430/month, actual CPC is 2-3x lower than top-of-page bid, Search alone yields ROAS 1-2.7x. Recommendation: multichannel (Search + LSA + YouTube + Meta) delivers ROAS 5-24x. Seasonal strategy with annual ad spend $17-27K and projected revenue $45-216K in peak quarter."

**TL;DR:** Evaluated Google Ads potential for a permanent LED lighting installer in LA. Google Search alone doesn't scale — tops out at 75–89 clicks/month on a $3K budget, ROAS 1-2.7x. Multichannel (Search + LSA + YouTube + Meta) delivers 5-24x. Here's the methodology with real Keyword Planner API data.

A client asked me: "Should I invest in Google Ads?" Simple question, but the right answer requires data, not guesswork. I ran Keyword Planner API forecasts at 11 bid levels, pulled industry benchmarks, and built actual CPC curves. Here's what I found.

## The Business

A company installing permanent LED facade lighting for residential homes in Los Angeles. Smart systems controlled via app — for holidays, everyday ambiance, and security.

- **Average ticket:** $3,000–$8,000 per project (HomeGuide, HomeAdvisor benchmarks)
- **Target:** upper-middle class homeowners, homes $800K–$3M
- **Niche:** permanent outdoor lighting, growing 9.8% annually
- **Current presence:** Instagram with 1,000+ followers. No website

Key blocker: you can technically run Google Ads to an Instagram profile, but without your own landing page there's no conversion tracking, no click-to-call CTA, and no funnel control. And LSA requires a Google Business Profile regardless.

## Methodology: Two Data Types

I explicitly separate data sources in every analysis — and you should too:

- **KP** — actual Google Keyword Planner API data: search volume, bid estimates, click/impression forecasts
- **bench** — industry benchmarks (LocaliQ, WordStream, Grand View Research): conversion rates, close rates, cost per lead

Why separate them? So the client knows where you have hard data versus informed estimates. KP shows demand and click costs. But conversion to lead and sale — that's where benchmarks come in.

## Keyword Analysis

Data pulled for the LA metro area, grouped by priority:

**Priority 1 — hot installation queries:**

| Query | Vol/month | Bid range | Competition |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| christmas light installation | 320 | $181–$577 | HIGH |
| permanent outdoor lighting | 210 | $63–$189 | HIGH |
| christmas lights installation near me | 140 | $206–$655 | HIGH |

**Priority 2 — consideration (comparison shoppers):**

| Query | Vol/month | Bid range | Competition |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| christmas light installation cost | 70 | $136–$492 | LOW |
| best permanent outdoor lights | 50 | $75–$200 | HIGH |
| permanent christmas lights cost | 10 | $42–$145 | HIGH |

The "cost" query at LOW competition is the best opportunity here — 70 searches/month with less bidding pressure.

**Priority 3 — branded Govee queries** (dominant brand in the niche): 720 searches/month. But these are mostly DIY buyers. For a professional installation service, it's a conquest play with lower conversion.

**Total volume:** ~2,900 searches/month, surging to 6,000–8,000 in peak November. Impression ceiling in LA: ~1,430/month.

## The CPC Curve: What Keyword Planner Hides

Keyword Planner hides the real cost per click. Top-of-page bid and actual CPC are two very different numbers:

- **Top-of-page bid** — $110–$655. That's the price for position #1. NOT the average CPC
- **Actual avg CPC** — always lower thanks to second-price auction mechanics

I ran Forecast at 11 bid levels ($1–$500). Results for November (peak season):

| Bid | Clicks | Avg CPC | Spend |
|-----|--------|---------|-------|
| $10 | 11 | $9 | $99 |
| $15 | 13 | $14 | $171 |
| $50 | 89 | $40 | $3,567 |
| $100 | 143 | $78 | $11,248 |
| $200 | 176 | $134 | $23,533 |

Three takeaways:

1. **There's a ceiling.** You can't buy more than 1,430 impressions in LA at any bid
2. **Growth is nonlinear.** Doubling the bid from $50 to $100 gets +60% clicks but +215% spend
3. **Sweet spot at $3K/month:** bid $40–$50, avg CPC $35–$40, 75–89 clicks

In the off-season (June), traffic drops 5–10x. Impression ceiling: ~200/month. CPC also drops — $28 at a $50 bid.

## Why Search Alone Won't Scale

Here's the Search-only funnel for peak November:

- Budget: $3,000
- Clicks: 75–89 (KP)
- Leads (CVR 3–5%): 3–4 (bench)
- Customers (close rate 30%): 1 (bench)
- Revenue: $3,000–$8,000
- **ROAS: 1x–2.7x**

One or two customers a month. You can't build a business on that. Now compare with multichannel:

- Google Search: 1–2 leads
- Google LSA (Local Services Ads): 10–20 leads at $30–$50 CPL
- YouTube + Meta retargeting: 5–10 leads
- **Total:** 16–32 leads/month → 5–9 customers → **ROAS 5–24x**

An order of magnitude difference. Same $3,000/month budget, but distributed across channels.

## Media Split and Seasonal Strategy

Recommended split for $3,000/month:

| Channel | Budget | Role |
|---------|--------|------|
| Google Search | $800 | Hot demand, installation queries |
| Local Services Ads | $800 | Best ROI for local services |
| YouTube | $600 | Before/after videos, awareness |
| Meta (Instagram) | $500 | Visual content + retargeting |
| Nextdoor/Yelp | $300 | Local presence |

During peak season (Oct–Dec) — shift 70% to Search + LSA. Off-season — shift to YouTube + Meta to build remarketing audiences for the next peak.

### Phased Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Mar–Apr)** — foundation. Ad spend $500–$1,000/month. Build landing page, set up Google Business Profile, launch LSA. Goal: first data and 1–2 customers.

**Phase 2 (May–Jul)** — SEO + awareness. Ad spend $1,000–$1,500/month. SEO for low-competition queries, YouTube and Meta for audience building. Goal: top-3 rankings, remarketing pool of 1,000+.

**Phase 3 (Aug–Sep)** — ramp up. Ad spend $2,000–$3,000/month. All channels at full capacity, geo-targeting premium zip codes (Beverly Hills, Bel Air, Calabasas). Goal: 10–15 leads/month.

**Phase 4 (Oct–Dec)** — peak season. Ad spend $3,000–$5,000/month. Revenue $15,000–$72,000/month. ROAS 5–24x.

Annual ad spend: $17,000–$27,500. Payback: 1–2 customers cover a month's budget.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Don't trust top-of-page bids.** Actual CPC is 2–3x lower. Run Forecast at multiple bid levels
2. **Search has a ceiling.** In a niche local market, you're looking at dozens of clicks, not thousands
3. **Multichannel isn't a buzzword — it's a necessity.** LSA delivers 5–10x more leads at the same budget
4. **Seasonality is an advantage.** 6 months before peak = time for SEO, reviews, and channel testing
5. **At $3K+ average ticket, one customer pays for a month of ads.** The barrier to entry is low

## FAQ

**How do you access Google Keyword Planner API data?**
You need a Google Ads account with active campaigns (or a test budget). API v23 provides Historical Metrics (volume, bids) and Forecast (projected clicks at different budgets). Free accounts show rounded ranges instead of exact figures.

**What's the difference between Local Services Ads and regular Search?**
LSA is pay-per-lead, not pay-per-click. You pay for calls or messages, not impressions. For home services, LSA CPL ($30–$50) is typically several times lower than Search CPA ($400–$600). But you need a Google Business Profile with reviews.

**Should you run ads without a website?**
Technically yes — you can even link to an Instagram profile. But without your own landing page there's no conversion tracking, no click-to-call, and no funnel control. Start with at least a single-page site: project gallery, pricing, CTA. LSA works without a website — it only needs your Google Business Profile.
