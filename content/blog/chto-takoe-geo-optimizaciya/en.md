**TL;DR:** GEO is website optimization for AI search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude). Unlike SEO where links and keywords matter most, GEO focuses on data structure, FAQ sections, and llms.txt files. Early adopters get the advantage.

Have you noticed how search behavior has changed? More people now ask ChatGPT instead of Google: "Which hotel should I choose in Miami?" or "Where can I get a DNA test in London?". And AI gives specific recommendations — with company names.

The question is: is your business in those answers?

## What is GEO

GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) is a set of techniques that help your website appear in AI system responses. Not in search results, but directly in the text that ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, or Gemini generates.

The difference is fundamental. In classic SEO, you compete for a position in a list of 10 links. In GEO, you compete for a mention in a ready-made answer. Users don't scroll through results — they get a recommendation immediately.

## Why This Matters Right Now

The numbers speak for themselves:

- 37% of users already use AI for searching products and services
- By the end of 2026, this figure will grow to 50%+
- Meanwhile, 90% of websites aren't optimized for AI search at all

This is a window of opportunity. While competitors think SEO is enough, you can claim your spot in AI responses. Catching up later will be harder.

I've seen this firsthand: a wellness resort chain implemented GEO optimization a month before their competitors. The result — Perplexity recommends them for 80% of relevant queries in their region. Competitors still don't appear in responses.

## How GEO Differs from SEO

| Parameter | SEO | GEO |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| Goal | Position in results | Mention in AI answer |
| Key factor | Links, keywords | Data structure, E-E-A-T |
| Content format | Texts for search queries | FAQ, structured data |
| Technical files | robots.txt, sitemap.xml | + llms.txt, Schema.org |
| Time to results | 3-6 months | 2-4 weeks |

GEO doesn't replace SEO — it complements it. If you have good SEO, adding GEO is easier. But you can also start from scratch.

## What AI Systems Check

When ChatGPT or Perplexity decides who to recommend, they look at:

### The llms.txt File

Think of it as robots.txt, but for AI. A text file in your site root that explains to AI systems who you are and what you do. Without it, AI has to guess — and often guesses wrong.

### Schema.org Markup

Structured data that AI understands without interpretation. Especially important:
- LocalBusiness — for local queries
- FAQPage — questions and answers in explicit form
- Article — for blog and expert content

### E-E-A-T Signals

Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness. AI evaluates whether you can be trusted:
- Is there information about the author?
- Are contacts and address listed?
- Are there reviews and mentions on other sites?

### AI Bot Accessibility

Some websites block AI crawlers in robots.txt. This protects content but excludes you from recommendations. You need balance.

## How to Start with GEO

Five steps you can do yourself:

**1. Create llms.txt**

A text file with basic information: name, services, contacts, key facts. Place it in your site root.

**2. Add FAQ to Key Pages**

Not a formal "Questions and Answers" section, but real customer questions with specific answers. Mark up with Schema.org FAQPage.

**3. Check robots.txt**

Make sure AI bots (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot) aren't blocked. Or are blocked intentionally.

**4. Add Structured Data**

Minimum — LocalBusiness for your homepage. Ideally — markup for each content type.

**5. Test the Result**

Ask ChatGPT and Perplexity about your niche in your region. Are you in the answers? If not — analyze who is and why.

## Free Check

On the [GEO Audit page](/en/services/geo/) there's a free Health Score — an automatic check of 5 GEO optimization parameters. Takes 30 seconds, shows what to fix first.

## FAQ

**How much does GEO optimization cost?**
The free Health Score provides basic diagnostics. A full GEO audit with recommendations and ready-to-use code is $500. This is a one-time service, not a monthly subscription.

**Will GEO replace SEO?**
No. These are different channels. SEO brings traffic from Google and Bing, GEO — from AI systems. Ideally, they work together.

**How fast will results appear?**
AI systems update data faster than search engines. After implementing changes, you'll see results in 2-4 weeks. Sometimes faster.
