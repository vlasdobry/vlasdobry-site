**TL;DR:** Conducted competitor analysis for a 4-star hotel in Russia. Found 7 competitors, compared across 8 metrics. Key finding: the hotel occupies a unique congress-hotel niche, but its 4.4 rating is below competitors — reputation management is priority #1.

Why should a hotel know its competitors? Not to copy them. But to find your niche and stop wasting budget fighting head-on against stronger players.

## The Brief

A 4-star hotel reached out: thermal spa with pool, conference room for 100 people, banquet hall for 450 guests. Rates from $35 to $70 per night.

The question: who are our competitors and how do we differentiate?

## Methodology

I don't use expensive tools like Ahrefs or SEMrush for basic competitor analysis. Here's what actually matters:

**Data sources:**
- Google Maps — ratings, reviews, photos
- Competitor websites — pricing, USP, amenities
- TripAdvisor and Booking.com — tourist reviews
- Search results — who ranks for target queries

**What I check for each competitor:**

| Parameter | Why it matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| Star rating | Defines the segment |
| Pricing | Price positioning |
| Rating & reviews | Reputation and weak spots |
| Amenities | Spa, pool, conference facilities |
| USP | How they position themselves |
| Social media | Activity, audience size |

## Competitors Found

Searching for "4-star hotels [city]", "hotels with pool [city]", "conference hotels [region]" revealed 7 competitors:

**Direct competitors (same city):**
- Park Hotel (4★) — riverfront, from $30/night
- Alpen Park (5★) — alpine style, spa, from $65/night
- Lada Resort (4★) — forest location, beach, from $65/night

**Budget segment:**
- Two 2-3 star properties — from $25-28/night

**MICE competitors (50 miles away):**
- Lotte Hotel (5★) — 11 conference halls, from $220/night
- HolidayHall (4★) — 9,000 sq ft conference space, from $110/night

## Comparison Table

| Hotel | ★ | Price | Rating | Reviews | Pool | Conference |
|-------|---|-------|--------|---------|------|------------|
| **Client** | 4★ | $35-70 | 4.4 | 35 | Yes | 100 pax |
| Park Hotel | 4★ | from $30 | 5.0 | 349 | No | Yes |
| Alpen Park | 5★ | from $65 | 3.0 | 68 | Yes | — |
| Lada Resort | 4★ | from $65 | 8.4 | 173 | Yes | — |
| Lotte | 5★ | from $220 | 9.1 | 22 | Yes | 1500 pax |

Clear insight: the client is the only hotel in the city combining 4-star quality + pool + conference facilities at mid-range prices.

## Key Findings

### Threats

**Park Hotel** — main price competitor. 5.0 rating, 349 reviews. But no pool and sauna costs extra ($20/hour). Their advantage is reputation and price.

**Alpen Park** — premium spa alternative. 5 stars, cottages, French cosmetics in spa. But TripAdvisor rating is only 3.0 — complaints about restaurant prices.

**City hotels 50 miles away** — competitors for large events. Lotte can host 1,500 people vs client's 100. But they're far and expensive ($220+/night).

### Opportunities

**Unique niche.** No other hotel in the city offers: 4 stars + pool + conference facilities + reasonable prices. This needs to be communicated clearly.

**4.4 rating has room to grow.** Park Hotel has 349 reviews at 5.0 rating. Client has 35 reviews. Just need systematic review collection.

**Family segment.** Kids' playroom + pool + children under 4 stay free. Competitors don't promote this.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I provided 5 specific recommendations:

1. **Work on reviews.** Target: 100+ reviews within 6 months. QR codes in rooms, follow-up emails after checkout.

2. **Strengthen MICE positioning.** Dedicated landing page for corporate clients. Packages combining conference + accommodation + banquet.

3. **Launch weekend packages.** "Spa Weekend for Two", "Family Getaway". Compete with Alpen Park on price.

4. **Monitor Alpen Park.** When negative reviews spike — run targeted ads to their audience.

5. **Activate social media.** UGC from guests, stories from thermal spa, behind-the-scenes from events.

## What This Cost

I complete this type of analysis in 2-3 hours. All from public sources, no expensive subscriptions. The output: market understanding and a concrete action plan.

For comparison: agencies charge $500-1,000 for "competitive analysis" that's basically a table with prices and star ratings.

## FAQ

**How often should you update competitor analysis?**
Basic monitoring — quarterly. Full analysis — annually or when the market changes (new competitor, rebranding).

**Which metrics matter most?**
Rating and number of reviews. That's what guests see when choosing a hotel. Prices change, stars don't, but reputation takes years to build.

**Do you need paid tools?**
For marketing analysis — no. For SEO analysis (rankings, backlinks, traffic) — yes, but that's a separate project.
