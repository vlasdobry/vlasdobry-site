### Schema.org for Local Business: Which Markup Types You Need
**URL:** /blog/schema-org-dlya-biznesa/
**Category:** SEO
**Date:** 2026-02-02

Local businesses need at least three markup types for rich snippets and AI visibility.

Essential markup types:
- LocalBusiness (basic) — for any business with physical address
- Hotel — extends LocalBusiness with hotel-specific fields (stars, amenities, check-in/out)
- MedicalBusiness — for clinics and labs
- FAQPage — shows Q&A in search results
- BreadcrumbList — shows navigation path

How to add:
- JSON-LD in <head> (recommended)
- CMS plugins (Yoast, Rank Math)

Common mistakes:
- Wrong type (LocalBusiness instead of Hotel)
- Data mismatch (address in markup ≠ address on page)
- Missing required fields (name, address)
- Markup on wrong page

Schema.org is also important for GEO — AI systems read structured data to understand businesses.

### GEO Optimization: How to Get Mentioned by ChatGPT and Perplexity
**URL:** /blog/chto-takoe-geo-optimizaciya/
**Category:** GEO
**Date:** 2026-02-02

GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) is website optimization for AI search engines. Unlike SEO where links and keywords matter most, GEO focuses on data structure, FAQ sections, and llms.txt files.

Key points:
- 37% of users already use AI for searching products and services
- By end of 2026, this will grow to 50%+
- 90% of websites aren't optimized for AI search

What AI systems check:
- llms.txt file (like robots.txt but for AI)
- Schema.org markup
- E-E-A-T signals
- AI bot accessibility

How to start with GEO:
1. Create llms.txt
2. Add FAQ with Schema.org FAQPage markup
3. Check robots.txt for AI bot access
4. Add structured data
5. Test in ChatGPT and Perplexity

### SEO for Hotels: Where to Start in 2026
**URL:** /blog/seo-dlya-oteley/
**Category:** SEO
**Date:** 2026-02-01

Hotel SEO starts with technical foundation (robots.txt, sitemap.xml, Schema.org), continues with local SEO (Google Maps, Yandex Maps) and reputation management.

Key points:
- Every guest from search saves 15-25% OTA commission
- 60% of hotel searches are from mobile
- Local SEO is half the success for hotels

Technical SEO checklist:
- robots.txt and sitemap.xml
- HTTPS
- Mobile version
- Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, INP)
- Schema.org (Hotel, LocalBusiness, FAQPage)

Local SEO priorities:
- Google Maps / Yandex Maps profiles

- Review management

FAQ:
- Cost: From $1,500/month for comprehensive SEO
- Timeline: First results in 3-6 months, local SEO faster (1-2 months)
