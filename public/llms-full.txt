### Hotel Competitor Analysis: A 4-Star Property Case Study
**URL:** /blog/analiz-konkurentov-otelya-keys/
**Category:** MARKETING
**Date:** 2026-02-04

Real case study: how to analyze hotel competitors, which metrics matter, and what to do with the findings.

Key insight: Conducted competitor analysis for Grace Luxor, a 4-star hotel in Tolyatti, Russia. Found 7 competitors, compared across 8 metrics. Key finding: the hotel occupies a unique congress-hotel niche, but its 4.4 rating is below competitors — reputation management is priority #1.

FAQ:
- How often should you update competitor analysis? Basic monitoring — quarterly. Full analysis — annually or when the market changes (new competitor, rebranding).
- Which metrics matter most? Rating and number of reviews. That's what guests see when choosing a hotel. Prices change, stars don't, but reputation takes years to build.
- Do you need paid tools? For marketing analysis — no. For SEO analysis (rankings, backlinks, traffic) — yes, but that's a separate project.

### How to Prioritize Cities for Hotel SEO
**URL:** /blog/prioritizaciya-gorodov-seo-otelya/
**Category:** SEO
**Date:** 2026-02-04

How to pick the right cities for hotel SEO using traffic quality metrics. A 4-tier prioritization framework with real data.

Key insight: To prioritize cities, look beyond traffic volume. Focus on quality metrics: bounce rate, time on site, pages per session. A city with 3,000 visits and 13% bounce is more valuable than one with 15,000 visits and 25% bounce.

FAQ:
- How often should I revisit priorities? Quarterly. Seasonality affects geography: summer brings families from regional cities, winter brings corporate groups from major metros.
- What about international traffic? If bounce is under 25% and time exceeds 2 minutes — work with it. If metrics are poor — exclude from priorities but don't block the traffic.
- Do I need separate landing pages for every city? For Tier 1 — absolutely. For Tier 2 — ideally. For Tier 3 and 4 — no, better to optimize existing pages.

### GEO Optimization: How to Get Mentioned by ChatGPT and Perplexity
**URL:** /blog/chto-takoe-geo-optimizaciya/
**Category:** GEO
**Date:** 2026-02-02

What is GEO (Generative Engine Optimization), how it differs from SEO, and how to make AI systems recommend your business.

Key insight: GEO is website optimization for AI search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude). Unlike SEO where links and keywords matter most, GEO focuses on data structure, FAQ sections, and llms.txt files. Early adopters get the advantage.

FAQ:
- How much does GEO optimization cost? The free Health Score provides basic diagnostics. A full GEO audit with recommendations and ready-to-use code starts at $750. This is a one-time service, not a monthly subscription.
- Will GEO replace SEO? No. These are different channels. SEO brings traffic from Google and Bing, GEO — from AI systems. Ideally, they work together.
- How fast will results appear? AI systems update data faster than search engines. After implementing changes, you'll see results in 2-4 weeks. Sometimes faster.

### How to Check Your Website's SEO: 8-Point Checklist
**URL:** /blog/kak-proverit-seo-sayta/
**Category:** SEO
**Date:** 2026-02-02

Free tools and a simple checklist for quick SEO audit. Find critical errors in 10 minutes.

Key insight: Check 8 basic parameters: Title, Description, H1, robots.txt, sitemap.xml, HTTPS, mobile version, and page speed. Takes 10 minutes and reveals critical issues. For deeper analysis, you need a full audit.

FAQ:
- Can I rank my site with just this checklist? No. This is the minimum for indexing. To grow rankings, you need content, links, and user engagement work.
- How often should I check? After every major site update. Or monthly for maintenance.
- What if I find errors? Fix by priority: robots.txt and sitemap.xml first (affect indexing), then Title and Description (affect CTR), then everything else.

### Schema.org for Local Business: Which Markup Types You Need
**URL:** /blog/schema-org-dlya-biznesa/
**Category:** SEO
**Date:** 2026-02-02

Practical guide to Schema.org for hotels, spas, clinics. Ready-to-use code examples for LocalBusiness, Hotel, FAQPage.

Key insight: Local businesses need at least three markup types: LocalBusiness (or Hotel/MedicalBusiness), FAQPage, and BreadcrumbList. This enables rich snippets in search and helps AI systems understand your business.

FAQ:
- How many markup types can I have on one page? As many as needed. A hotel homepage typically has: Hotel + FAQPage + BreadcrumbList. Just make sure each type matches the page content.
- How quickly will Google see the markup? After page indexing. Usually 1-2 weeks. You can speed it up via "Request Indexing" in Search Console.
- Do I need to hire a developer? For simple cases — no. JSON-LD can be added through CMS or manually in HTML. For complex sites with hundreds of pages, automation is better.

### SEO for Hotels: Where to Start in 2026
**URL:** /blog/seo-dlya-oteley/
**Category:** SEO
**Date:** 2026-02-01

Step-by-step guide to hotel search engine optimization. Technical SEO, local search, reputation management.

Key insight: Hotel SEO starts with technical foundation (robots.txt, sitemap.xml, Schema.org), continues with local SEO (Google Maps, Bing Places) and reputation management. First results appear in 3-6 months.

FAQ:
- How much does hotel SEO cost? From $1,500/month for comprehensive promotion. Price depends on property size, market competition, and service scope.
- How soon will results appear? First rankings in 3-6 months. Local SEO shows results faster — from 1-2 months.
- Can I do without SEO? Yes, but it's expensive. OTAs take 15-25% from each booking. SEO is an investment in reducing dependence on intermediaries.
